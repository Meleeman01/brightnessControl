# brightnessControl
brightness control for a chromebook laptop running ubuntu and i3wm

in order to install/test run sudo ./install.sh in your terminal window

make sure the backlight command is set to wherever your backlight is ( within /sys/class/backlight)and you can accomplish a simpler lighter backlight rather than using something like xbacklight which is what I was using before.
